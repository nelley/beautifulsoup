He was first to suggestthat Marissa Mayer was in trouble, warning that investors were wary of herplan to spin out Alibaba shares. He was first to say Yahoo was likely topause the spinout of its stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba.Peck knows what's going on, and so when he says something, people shouldlisten.On Wednesday, Yahoo announced that it would not spin out Alibaba and wouldinstead spin out its internet businesses.On a call with analysts, Yahoo chairman Maynard Webb said, "There is nodetermination by the board to sell the company or any part of it."Webb said he thought that Yahoo was undervalued and that the company's focuswould be on revitalizing the company and getting investors to properly valuethe company.He also said, however, "The board has fiduciary obligation to engage with anylegitimate person that comes forward with a good offer."Peck believes that's more likely to happen. He says a strategic buyer likeVerizon or a private-equity firm is likely to step in and buy Yahoo, asopposed to Yahoo trying to figure out how to spin out its internet business."Given the simplicity and speed of a sale and the lack of a desire byinvestors to undergo a year-long spin process, we think a sale of the core orentire company is most likely," Peck writes.He believes a sale happens in the first half of 2016 because investors areimpatient, the core business isn't getting better, and the board wants toavoid a proxy war with shareholders.What is Yahoo's core business worth? Peck says $6 billion to $8 billion,which is five times a projected Ebitda (a financial term that gives a view ofthe operating profit of a business).YAHOO 究竟會不會賣出呢?!?!  梅姐才剛生了雙胞胎阿....--※ 發信站: 批踢踢實業坊(ptt.cc), 來自: 220.135.119.13※ 文章網址: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Tech_Job/M.1449795926.A.DD2.html推 ZZB: 底下的 comments 蠻有趣的 :p推文自動更新已關閉
