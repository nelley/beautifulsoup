In fact, Idistinctly remember an analyst from CLSA Securities explicitly suggestingthat Intel buy MediaTek, something that I wasn't so keen on at the time (as Iwas way too bullish on Intel's ability to deliver products for this marketorganically -- mea culpa).Interestingly, at the time that the analyst from CLSA suggested that Intelbuy MediaTek, shares of the Taiwan-based chip designer traded at around 420New Taiwan dollars per share, implying a market capitalization of roughly $20billion. A 30% premium to that would have run Intel $26 billion.Intel could surely raise the money to do such an acquisition given the kindof cash flow its business generates (the $16.7 billion buy of Altera provedto be no issue for the chip giant), but it definitely would have been steep.Today, MediaTek trades at around 211 New Taiwan dollars per share, suggestinga market capitalization of just $10 billion. A 30% premium to this pricewould run Intel about $13 billion, which -- even as the company tries todigest Altera -- would be more than doable.I believe that now would be an opportune time for the chipmaker to strikeand, once and for all, secure its place in the market for mobile chips bybuying MediaTek. Here's why.Intel gets a profitable, high-volume smartphone chipmakerMediaTek is not the leader in mobile applications processors; that honorbelongs to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). However, it is a quite strong No. 2 playerin this market and ships hundreds of millions of smartphone processors eachyear.MediaTek's processor portfolio is quite broad and deep, with chips servingeverything from the low-end of the phone market to the high end (althoughadmittedly its high-end solutions are still not in the same league asproducts from Qualcomm, all things considered).MediaTek is also fairly profitable, although intensifying competition in themarket and increased research and development spending has led to asubstantial drop in operating profit for the chipmaker (down 45% year overyear in the third quarter of 2015).At any rate, MediaTek's business is far more successful than Intel's mobilebusiness, which is still losing billions per year (albeit those losses arecoming down). With the MediaTek business under its belt, Intel would be "in"mobile devices and make a reasonable profit from it, too.MediaTek could become the new Intel mobileWith MediaTek under its belt, Intel could have a drop in replacement for itscurrent mobile efforts. Intel seems to be disinvesting quite significantly inits own efforts, with the company saying that its spending in the mobilesegment will have come down by about $1 billion by the time 2016 is out from2014 levels.Intel could actually just run MediaTek basically as a separate companyinstead of trying to really integrate it into the Intel organization in ameaningful way.The one area where it would make sense for anything potentially resemblingintegration is that MediaTek should have the option, but should not be forcedto, use Intel Custom Foundry to build its chips. If MediaTek management, evenunder the Intel umbrella, feel that they can gain an edge over thecompetition (i.e., Qualcomm) by using Intel manufacturing technology, theycan do so, but if they deem it more advantageous from acost/time-to-market/etc. perspective to use a third party foundry, theyshould have the flexibility and freedom to do so.10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay tolisten.

The analyst noted anacquisition of MediaTek is Intel's best option to grow in the wirelessmarket. Intel may also find that the timing is improving for a large deal asthe baseband market continues to consolidate, the analyst said.STOCKS TO BUY: TheStreet Quant Ratings has identified a handful of stockswith serious upside potential in the next 12-months.

In contrast to Intel,MediaTek has made steady market share gains in the baseband market.After acquiring Infineon's wireless solutions business for $1.4 billion in2010, Intel's baseband market share has fallen to the mid-single digits.Other companies such as MediaTek and Qualcomm (QCOM) have benefited from aconsolidating market, especially as players as large as Texas Instruments(TXI) exit the market. Qualcomm's baseband market share has grown to 62% asof 2013, while MediaTek has grown to 14.4%.In spite of Intel's struggles, Freedman believes the company has increasedspending within its Mobile &amp; Communications division from $1.2 billionannually at the time of the Infineon acquisition to $4 billion this year.Despite that rising spending, the division isn't expected to post revenuegrowth in the next two and a half years, according to Wall Street consensus.An acquisition of MediaTek, which currently operates at a profit and hasstrong gross margins, could save Intel money, according to Freedman.SMALL INVESTMENT, BIG POTENTIAL.

He forecasts synergy between MediaTek's operations andIntel's foundries, which could boost MediaTek's gross margins to 60%, whilealso increasing Intel's foundry utilization.Sticker ShockFreedman calculates in his note that Intel would likely have to pay around$27 billion for MediaTek, a 30% premium to the company's current enterprisevalue. He said in a telephone interview that a deal would likely beimmediately accretive at that price, because reduced spending in the wirelessmarket would more than offset financing costs on the debt needed to fund anacquisition.The analyst also said a deal would utilize Intel's offshore cash hoard, andthat additional financing would be easily repaid by Intel even as the companypursues share buybacks.Intel's other alternative is simply to close the spigot on its wirelessinvestment. While such a move might immediately boost Intel's stock upwardsof $40 a share, according to Freedman's estimates, it might be the wrongdecision for the chip-maker over the long term."Intel can enhance the PC user experience from success in mobile, so we donot ascribe a lot of credibility to the idea that Intel should exit mobile.Our questions mainly surround why Intel is spending so much to be successfulin mobile," Freedman wrote.SMALL INVESTMENT, BIG POTENTIAL.

Freedmanargues Intel could reduce investment losses in the wireless segment with sucha move.Intel burning $1bn per quarter on mobile pushIntel is currently spending upwards of $1 billion a quarter on its ambitiousmobile expansion plans and so far it does not have much to show for it.MediaTek on the other hand is doing quite well and it has cemented itsposition as the world’s leading provider of value SoC designs. Freedman saysbuying MediaTek could be a “less expensive way” to increase market shareand it would entail less risk."Instead of Intel continuing to spend $4-$6 billion a year to enter themarket (higher end of spending range as it achieves success), hypothetically,an acquisition of MediaTek may reallocate Intel's best-in-classunder-utilized fabs and financial resources to a rising star in thesystem-on-chip world, solidifying MediaTek's market position," the analystwrote in a note.MediaTek is anything but cheapAlthough MediaTek is usually associated with cheap chips, the company is theworld’s second biggest supplier of ARM-based processors.Freedman estimates the value of a potential Intel bid to take over thecompany at $27 billion. That is a 30 percent premium to MediaTek’s currentvalue. However, he argues that the deal would still be beneficial to Intel,as it would save money in the long run. Therefore he believes some sort ofdeal is inevitable.Until recently Intel did not cross paths with the likes of MediaTek,Rockchip, Allwinner or any of a number of ARM chip designers. That changedearlier this year when the US chipmaker started aggressively pursuing tabletdesign wins.Intel surprised many observers when it reached a deal with Rockchip last May.Under the deal Rockchip will start selling Intel SoFIA chips in mid-2015.Rockchip is focused on tablets, while MediaTek tends to go after phones.Intel wants both and so far it hasn’t had much luck with either marketsegment.http://www.fudzilla.com/35554-analyst-reckons-intel-could-buy-mediatek------------------窩英文布豪，直接按END惹，幫QQ阿不就外資越多越安全，阿不就中性資金好棒棒，頗呵----※ 發信站: 批踢踢實業坊(ptt.cc), 來自: 60.249.21.2※ 文章網址: https://www.ptt.cc/bbs/Tech_Job/M.1465960435.A.78D.html→ DCHC: 市場經濟，契約自由。→ brightest: 美資買 覺醒青年就會閉嘴了→ dslite: the fool都平民在寫的推文自動更新已關閉
